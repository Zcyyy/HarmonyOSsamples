# Foreground Service<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0000001117613318"></a>



##### Introduction<a name="section9511023719"></a>

This sample describes how to use a foreground Service ability for a music player.

In certain scenarios, a foreground Service ability is required, for example, when the user expects to keep a music player app running. When a foreground Service ability is running for an app, the status bar shows an icon indicating that the app is running.

##### Usage Guidelines<a name="section182537201392"></a>

In this sample, there are three buttons on the home screen:

**Start Play**: starts the foreground Service ability and plays music.

**Pause Play**: pauses music playback, while the foreground Service ability continues to run.

**Stop Play**: stops music playback and closes the foreground Service ability.
