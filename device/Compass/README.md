-   Sensors are abstraction of underlying hardware-based sensors. Your application can access the underlying sensors via sensors. Using the application programming interfaces \(APIs\) provided by sensors, you can query sensors on your device, subscribe to sensor data, customize algorithms based on sensor data, and develop various applications.

    This sample uses implementing a simple compass to demonstrate how to use sensor APIs, such as obtaining a sensor and subscribing to or unsubscribing from sensor data.
