If they are first connected into a line horizontally, vertically and obliquely, they will win. If both sides play correctly, they will be drawn. This game is actually controlled by the first player. The first player is attacking and the second player is defending."

If the second player is in the side position, the first player can tie down the second player with two wires, and then create \"two snakes\".
