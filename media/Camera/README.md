### Introduction

The camera module enables your app to provide camera functions. You can access and operate camera devices and develop new functions through the open APIs. Common operations include preview, photographing, burst photographing, and video recording.

You may also implement flash control, exposure time control, focus mode control, zooming control, facial recognition, and many others by using an API or a combination of APIs.

### Usage

2. Touch **Video Record** to record a video.
