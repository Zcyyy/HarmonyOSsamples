# Drawing Triangles Using OpenGL

### Introduction

Open Graphics Library (OpenGL) is a cross-platform, high-performance API for rendering 3D graphics. OpenGL for Embedded Systems (ES) is a version designed for embedded devices.

This sample is developed using Java. It shows you how to use OpenGL ES to draw a triangle in the coordinate system and rotate the triangle frame by frame.

### Usage

Touch **Apply** to rotate the triangle around the vertex.

### Constraints

This sample can only be run on the HarmonyOS system.
